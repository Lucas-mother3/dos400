# MS-DOS 4.00 
This is MS-DOS 4.00 taken from the Microsoft repo:
https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS

This is based off the modifications made by neozeed (of Virtually Fun) and other fellas. This is mainly a fork to experiment with the source code, maybe even translating it into Filipino (for the fun of it).

This is based off huge hard work from Microsoft and IBM.

> Yes, it does compile.  Yes it can DOES boot from Hard Disk.  Yes the CALL 5 debug thing has been patched.
Enjoy!
