# MS-DOS 4.00: Filipino Edition
Maligayang pagdating! Ito ay isang hinding opisyal na paglapat ng Microsoft MS-DOS 4.00 sa wikang Filipino! 

Base ito sa fork ni neozeed para ma-isagawa ito sa loob ng isang sistemang DOS.

Ito'y pra lamang sa pag-experiment at katuwaan, na nag-aayon sa lisensya ng MIT.
