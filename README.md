This is MS-DOS 4.00 taken from the Microsoft repo:
https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS

I just wanted a clean break to focus on the 4.0 part, all the terms conditions are the same it's all Microsoft & IBMs hard work,
not mine.  I just kept hitting random keys until something happened.

Yes, it does compile.  Yes it can not boot from Hard Disk.  Yes the CALL 5 debug thing has been patched.
Enjoy!
